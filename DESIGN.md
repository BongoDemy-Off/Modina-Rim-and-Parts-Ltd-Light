Premium Light Design System v2.0
Optimized for Google Antigravity 2.0
OBJECTIVE
Redesign the entire website into a world-class premium manufacturing website while preserving every feature, route, business logic, API integration, SEO structure, responsiveness, accessibility, and performance.

DO NOT redesign functionality.

ONLY redesign the visual system.

The final result should look comparable to Apple, Bosch, Stripe, Siemens, SKF, Continental, and other premium international manufacturers.

The website should immediately communicate:

Premium Manufacturing
International Quality
Engineering Excellence
Trust
Innovation
Clean Modern Design
The client explicitly requested:

White background
Light premium UI
Larger text
Better readability
Cleaner layout
More premium appearance
This design system MUST satisfy those requirements.

Never flashy. Never cluttered. Never overly colorful.
Never futuristic cyberpunk. Never dark. Never glassmorphism-heavy. Never neumorphism.

Ensure dark mode tokens are safely overwritten or removed to prevent styling conflicts.
Utilize Tailwind's container queries and flex/grid utilities to achieve the specified 12-column layout and whitespace rules.
COMPONENT GUIDELINES

WHAT TO REMOVE

WHAT TO KEEP

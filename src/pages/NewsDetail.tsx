    body: [
      'Modina Rim & Parts Ltd. is proud to announce the successful renewal of its ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System certification for the 2025–2026 cycle. The annual surveillance audit was conducted by LMS Certification Limited over three days at our Jhumjhumpur, Jashore manufacturing facility.',
      'The audit covered all major production processes including raw material inspection, CNC machining, heat treatment, surface finishing, dimensional quality control, and final dispatch certification. The audit team reviewed 18 months of production records, corrective action logs, customer feedback data, and employee training records.',
      'We are particularly pleased that the audit concluded with zero major non-conformances and zero minor non-conformances — a result that reflects the dedication of our entire team to maintaining the highest standards in every step of our manufacturing process.',
      '"This certification renewal is not merely a formality," said Md. Faruq Hossain, Managing Director. "It is proof that our commitment to quality management has become genuinely embedded in our culture. Every worker on our floor understands why these standards matter."',
      'The ISO 9001:2015 certification, first awarded in April 2023 under certificate number BD99166A, covers the design, manufacture, and supply of automotive rim and parts components. The renewal is valid through April 2026, with the next full recertification audit scheduled for Q2 2026.',

    excerpt: 'Following market demand from commercial operators, Modina has introduced a reinforced CNG rim variant engineered for higher load ratings and extended service life.',
    body: [
      'Modina Rim & Parts Ltd. has officially launched a new reinforced variant of its popular CNG Rim product, specifically engineered to meet the demands of high-cycle commercial fleet operators across Bangladesh.',
      'The new variant features a 15% increased wall thickness in the spoke-to-barrel junction area — the primary failure point identified through analysis of field returns over the past two years. The updated design also incorporates a revised spoke geometry that distributes load stress more evenly across the full rim profile.',
      'Commercial CNG operators typically run their vehicles 16–20 hours per day, compared to 8–10 hours for private use. This duty cycle places significantly greater stress on rim components, particularly the spoke welds and barrel seam. The new variant addresses these specific failure modes.',
      'Key technical improvements in the new CNG Rim variant include: reinforced spoke-to-barrel junction (15% thicker), revised spoke geometry for improved load distribution, enhanced powder coating process for corrosion resistance, and updated quality certification batch testing at 120% rated load.',
      '"We listened to fleet operators and worked backward from the failure data," said the Head of Product Engineering. "The result is a rim that should last 40% longer under commercial operating conditions."',
      'The new CNG Rim variant is available from our Jashore facility in both standard black and silver finishes. Minimum order quantity is 100 units. Contact our sales team for distributor pricing.',
